## Summary

This proposal describes how the resource values of containers injected by SidecarSet change according to Pod specification information during the Pod creation process, allowing Sidecar containers (only injected by Kruise SidecarSet) to adjust in response to changes in designated containers. This addresses the need for dynamic resource specification configuration in scenarios involving proxy services like Istio.

## Motivation
[issue#2123](https://github.com/openkruise/kruise/issues/2123)
SidecarSet provides the capability to inject containers into a specified batch of Pods, but previously, the resource values of the Sidecar containers could only be fixed values. Now, as SidecarSet is increasingly applied in proxy scenarios, the traffic of proxy services is positively correlated with the specifications of the main containers. Therefore, we hope that the resources of the SidecarSet containers can change in accordance with the injected Pod specs.

### Goals

- Provide configuration rules for SidecarSet container resources in the form of extending the CR API
- Support dynamic resource configuration for SidecarSet containers during pod creation

### Non-Goals/Future Work

- Non-creating scenarios: dynamic adjustment of sidecar container resources during Pod in-place updates
- Dependencies on the resources of other Sidecar containers

## Proposal

Overall, we expect the resources of the Sidecar container to change during creation based on the resource conditions of multiple containers within the Pod. Therefore, a new field sidecarSet.spec.containers[].resourcesPolicy will be created to receive this configuration.

### API Definition
The complete API expression is as follows.
```
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: SidecarSet
spec:
   containers:
    - name: sidecar1
      image: centos:6.7
      resourcesPolicy:
        targetContainerMode: sum|max # <required, enum, validatd by CRD>
        targetContainersNameRegex: ^large.engine.v.*$ # <required, validate by webhook>, if non-matched container name, this pod creating request will be rejected by webhook.
        resourceExpr: # <validated by webhook, should not contain scalar resources, only support cpu and memory>, If calculate result is negative, this pod creating request will be rejected by webhook.
          limits: # If matched container resources.limits not configured, sidecar container resources.limits will also won't be configured.
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: max(memory*50%, 100Mi)
          requests: # If matched container resources.requests not configured, corresponding resource value will be treated as 0.
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 100Mi
```
### User Stories
#### Story 1 - By specific container name 
```
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: SidecarSet
spec:
   containers:
    - name: sidecar1
      image: centos:6.7
      resourcesPolicy:
        targetContainerMode: sum
        targetContainersNameRegex: ^large.engine.v4$ # only apply to container large.engine.v4
        resourceExpr:
          limits:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 100Mi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: large.engine.v4
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
  - name: large.engine.v8
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
```
In this case, sidecar container resources will be:
```
limits:
  cpu: max(sum(200m) * 50%, 50m ) = 100m
  memory: 200Mi
requests:
  cpu: max(sum(50m) * 50%, 50m ) = 50m
  memory: 100Mi
```
#### Story 2 - By sum of container resources
```
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: SidecarSet
spec:
   containers:
    - name: sidecar1
      image: centos:6.7
      resourcesPolicy:
        targetContainerMode: sum
        targetContainersNameRegex: ^large.engine.v.*$
        resourceExpr:
          limits:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 100Mi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: large.engine.v4
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
  - name: large.engine.v8
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 400m
        memory: 400Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 200Mi
```
In this case, sidecar container resources will be:
```
limits:
  cpu: max((200m + 400m) * 50%, 50m ) = 300m
  memory: 200Mi
requests:
  cpu: max((50m + 100m) * 50%, 50m ) = 75m
  memory: 100Mi
```

#### Story 3 - By max of container resources
```
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: SidecarSet
spec:
   containers:
    - name: sidecar1
      image: centos:6.7
      resourcesPolicy:
        targetContainerMode: max
        targetContainersNameRegex: ^large.engine.v.*$
        resourceExpr:
          limits:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: max(cpu*50%, 50m)
            memory: 100Mi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: large.engine.v4
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
  - name: large.engine.v8
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 400m
        memory: 400Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 200Mi
```
In this case, sidecar container resources will be:
```
limits:
  cpu: max(max(200m, 400m) * 50%, 50m ) = 200m
  memory: 200Mi
requests:
  cpu: max(max(50m, 100m) * 50%, 50m ) = 50m
  memory: 100Mi
```

### Requirements (Optional)

- FeatureGate: PodWebhook=true

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

- Main modification is in the `/pkg/webhook/pod/mutating/sidecarset.go::buildSidecars` Function.
- Expression evaluation engine will use `goyacc` to generate the parser and add fuzz test.

### Risks and Mitigations

- Any processes unrelated to creation need to remain consistent with the original.

## Design Details
### ResourceExpr Calculator
- Calculator: +, -, *, /, max(), min()
- Number: int, float, percent
- If matched container resources.limits not configured, sidecar container resources.limits will not be configured.
- If matched container resources.requests not configured, corresponding resource value will be treated as 0.
- If calculate result is negative, this pod creating request will be rejected by webhook.

### Test Plan [optional]
#### Unit Test
#### E2E Test
