# Title

- Keep it simple and descriptive.
- A good title can help communicate what the proposal is and should be considered as part of any review.

<!-- BEGIN Remove before PR -->
To get started with this template:
1. **Make a copy of this template.**
  Copy this template into `docs/proposals` and name it `YYYYMMDD-my-title.md`, where `YYYYMMDD` is the date the proposal was first drafted.
1. **Fill out the required sections.**
1. **Create a PR.**
  Aim for single topic PRs to keep discussions focused.
  If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR with suggested changes.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source of this file) is [here](./YYYYMMDD-template.md).

The `Metadata` section above is intended to support the creation of tooling around the proposal process.
This will be a YAML section that is fenced as a code block.
See the proposal process for details on each of these items.

## Table of Contents

A table of contents is helpful for quickly jumping to sections of a proposal and for highlighting
any additional information provided beyond the standard proposal template.
[Tools for generating](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) a table of contents from markdown are available.

## Glossary

Refer to the [Cluster API Book Glossary](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html).

If this proposal adds new terms, or defines some, make the changes to the book's glossary when in PR stage.

## Summary

The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality user-focused documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.
It should be possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release notes and implementing the feature itself.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

## Motivation

This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of this proposal.

- Describe why the change is important and the benefits to users.
- The motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports)
to demonstrate the interest in a proposal within the wider Kubernetes community.

### Goals

- List the specific high-level goals of the proposal.
- How will we know that this has succeeded?

### Non-Goals/Future Work

- What high-levels are out of scope for this proposal?
- Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion and make progress.

## Proposal

This is where we get down to the nitty gritty of what the proposal actually is.

- What is the plan for implementing this feature?
- What data model changes, additions, or removals are required?
- Provide a scenario, or example.
- Use diagrams to communicate concepts, flows of execution, and states.

[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com) is the preferred tool to generate diagrams,
place your `.plantuml` files under `images/` and run `make diagrams` from the docs folder.

### User Stories

- Detail the things that people will be able to do if this proposal is implemented.
- Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of the system.
- The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting bogged down.

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Requirements (Optional)

Some authors may wish to use requirements in addition to user stories.
Technical requirements should be derived from user stories, and provide a trace from
use case to design, implementation and test case. Requirements can be prioritised
using the MoSCoW (MUST, SHOULD, COULD, WON'T) criteria.

The difference between goals and requirements is that between an executive summary
and the body of a document. Each requirement should be in support of a goal,
but narrowly scoped in a way that is verifiable or ideally - testable.

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are the properties that this design should include.

##### FR1

##### FR2

#### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are user expectations of the solution. Include
considerations for performance, reliability and security.

##### NFR1

##### NFR2

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

- What are some important details that didn't come across above.
- What are the caveats to the implementation?
- Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
- Talk about core concepts and how they release.

### Risks and Mitigations

- What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
- How will UX be reviewed and by whom?
- How will security be reviewed and by whom?
- Consider including folks that also work outside the SIG or subproject.

## Alternatives

The `Alternatives` section is used to highlight and record other possible approaches to delivering the value proposed by a proposal.

## Upgrade Strategy

If applicable, how will the component be upgraded? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade strategy for this enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing cluster required to make on upgrade in order to keep previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing cluster required to make on upgrade in order to make use of the enhancement?
