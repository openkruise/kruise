                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                          This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                          Default value is 0.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                          that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                          can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                          The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                          pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                          on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                          reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                          pod is immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
                          Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                          daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                          so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                          cause evictions during disruption.
