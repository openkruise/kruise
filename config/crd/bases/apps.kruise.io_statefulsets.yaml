                  podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up,

                  pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before
                  continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order.
                  The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel
                  to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete
