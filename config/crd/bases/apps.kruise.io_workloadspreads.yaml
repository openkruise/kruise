                          CreatingPods contains information about pods whose creation was processed by
                          the webhook handler but not yet been observed by the WorkloadSpread controller.
                          A pod will be in this map from the time when the webhook handler processed the
                          creation request to the time when the pod is seen by controller.
                          The key in the map is the name of the pod and the value is the time when the webhook
                          handler process the creation request. If the real creation didn't happen and a pod is
                          still in this map, it will be removed from the list automatically by WorkloadSpread controller
                          after some time.
                          If everything goes smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time.
                          Large number of entries in the map may indicate problems with pod creations.

                  VersionedSubsetStatuses is to solve rolling-update problems, where the creation of new-version pod
                  may be earlier than deletion of old-version pod. We have to calculate the pod subset distribution for
                  each version.
