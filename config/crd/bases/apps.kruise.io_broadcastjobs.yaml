                      ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished
                      execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set,
                      ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be
                      automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle
                      guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset,
                      the Job won't be automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero,
                      the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes.
                      This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the
                      TTLAfterFinished feature.
