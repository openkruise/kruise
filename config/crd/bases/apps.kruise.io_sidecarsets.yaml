                      Starting from Kruise 1.8.0, the updateStrategy.Selector affects the version of the Sidecar container
                      injected into newly created Pods by a SidecarSet configured with an injectionStrategy.
                      In most cases, all newly created Pods are injected with the specified Sidecar version as configured in injectionStrategy.revision,
                      which is consistent with previous versions.
