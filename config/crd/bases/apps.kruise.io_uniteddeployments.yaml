                                  Priorities are the rules for calculating the priority of updating pods.
                                  Each pod to be updated, will pass through these terms and get a sum of weights.

                                      First, all pods which have key1 in labels will be sorted by the value of key1.
                                      Then, the left pods which have no key1 but have key2 in labels will be sorted by
                                      the value of key2 and put behind those pods have key1.

                                  - Note that pods will be scattered after priority sort. So, although priority strategy and scatter strategy can be applied together, we suggest to use either one of them.
                                  - If scatterStrategy is used, we suggest to just use one term. Otherwise, the update order can be hard to understand.
